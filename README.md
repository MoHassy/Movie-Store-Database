# Movie-Store-Database-GUI

In this project, I designed a Online Movie Store database in oracle using SQL as well as a graphical user interface using JavaFX

The application is intended to allow users that don't know any Standard Query Language to have a simple graphical user interface to create tables, populate tables with preset records, insert records that they manually specify,delete records and drop the tables if necessary.

The project uses Java for the backend and JavaFX for the frontend, JDBC to connect to the database, SQL for the DDL and DML, and local Oracle database to physically store the data
